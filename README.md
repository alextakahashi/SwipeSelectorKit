> TL;DR Swipe Right, Swipe Left - That's it.  Have a hackthon idea? Fork this and build something cool!

This project was inspired by a few hackathon designs I've seen this year while mentoring for [Cal Hacks](https://calhacks.io/).  This swipeable UI is a popular design pattern to accept/reject a list of items.

## Interactions
* **Swipe Right** - *accept*
* **Swipe Left** - *reject*

## Liability

## Getting Started

1. âœ… Fork the Project
2. âœ… Build + Run 
3. âœ… Swipe!
